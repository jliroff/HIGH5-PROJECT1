# HIGH5-PROJECT1

Mental Health in the Workplace

Mental health awareness has become an increasingly important issue in our current society. Our motivation behind this project was to unravel how much of a presence there is of mental health disorders, specifically in the workplace.

Research Questions: 

How does the frequency of mental health disorder vary? We focused on age, gender and company size.

What are the strongest predictors of mental health disorder or certain attitudes towards mental health in the workplace?
We focused on people who currently have a mental disorder, how aware they are of their mental healthcare options, and if productivity at work is an issue.
